### Front-end Web Developper

Worked on the front-end overhaul of the back-office in support of the Lead Front-end Developer. Responsibilities included fetching and integrating data from the API and integrating a SMS sending module. Utilized tools such as React.js, Sass, Git/GitHub, Figma, Storybook, Docker, Asana, and VirtualBox to accomplish tasks effectively and efficiently.
