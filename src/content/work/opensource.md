### Open-Source Developer

I have actively contributed to open source projects, including the development of a mobile application designed to facilitate hospital visits for patients. This project focused on enhancing the experience of visitors and improving patient interactions within hospital settings.

Additionally, I have contributed to the Java-based project "cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics," which provides tools for visualization, analysis, and downloading large-scale cancer genomics datasets. My contributions included improving the platform and adding new features, supporting the research and developer community involved in cancer genomics.
