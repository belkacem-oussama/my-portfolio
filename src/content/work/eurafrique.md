I developed a volunteer management system for the EurAfrique association. This system streamlines the tracking and management of volunteer attendance by making it easy to log the presence and absence of each volunteer. With this tool, EurAfrique can now accurately monitor volunteer participation, providing clear insights into attendance patterns. It simplifies resource allocation and ensures that events and activities are properly staffed. By enhancing volunteer management, this system allows the association to focus more on its mission and less on administrative tasks.
